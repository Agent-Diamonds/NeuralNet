# NeuralNet

A basic artificial neural network (ANN) built from scratch as part of a project to better understand how ANNs work.

Algorithm is designed to be trainable on any dataset, but as as a test of code functionality the MNIST dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) was used to test the network.
